  <h1>The Gratitude Exercise</h1>

  <p>Our study showed that gratitude boosts happiness for a variety of reasons - which is why Prof. Sonja Lyubomirsky
    calls it a "meta strategy". This exercise involves showing gratitude to a person who has had a positive influence in
    your life.</p>

  <p>The first step involves thinking of someone who had a positive influence on your life. This person could be someone
    from your past (e.g., teacher, mentor) or present (e.g., friend, spouse). It is ideal to think of someone who is
    still alive. If you prefer to write your letter to someone who has passed on, read the letter to someone who knew
    this person. For example, if you write your letter to your late uncle,
    you could read it to your uncleâ€™s sister, wife, son, etc.</p>

  <p>In the space below, type out the name of the recipient of your letter:</p>
  <label class="mr-2">Recipient</label>
  <input type="text">

  <p>Now, think of all the reasons why this person had a positive influence in your life and then type out your thoughts
    in the space below in the form of a letter. Make this a relatively longish letter, but not too long. You should aim
    to write three or four paragraphs.</p>
